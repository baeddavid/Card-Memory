Added a permutation algorithm (Sattolo Cycle) that shuffles the cards in linear time complexity.

Added a reset button that would flip the cards over again, and shuffle them.

Added a live point counter. It will count to 5 before declaring either CPU or player as the winner.

Added a count down timer that will automatically assign a point to the CPU if the player fails to make a move before the time is up.
